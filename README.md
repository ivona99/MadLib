# MadLib Project
Task:
-Mad Libs, it takes a story of your choice, and then allows the user to replace words with (hopefully) far more hilarious words!
You, as a developer, ask the user, who hasn't seen the story, to fill in the blanks with adjectives, nouns, exclamations, colors, verbs, etc., and after these words are inserted into the blanks, the story can be read aloud to hear the hilarious results.
